    <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹ | Thanks for visiting my GitHub Profile!</h1>
    <b>Im just a regular guy, that likes to code, mainly using C/C++, C#, and JavaScript.</b><br>
    I enjoy working with topics such as game hacking for Windows and PS4, and PS4-related scene development including payload development, jailbreaking, and more. Additionally, I have a keen interest in both analyzing, and developing (for testing), Malware's and Ransomware's.
    <br><br>
    <b>That being said, thanks for reading! And Have a fantastic day!ðŸ˜„</b>
