    <b>HiðŸ‘‹, thanks for checking out my GitHub profile!<br></b>
    I primarily use C/C++, JavaScript, and C#.
    And i enjoy working with topics such as game hacking for Windows and PS4, and PS4-related scene development including payload development, jailbreaking, and more.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, I have a keen interest in both analyzing, and developing (for testing), Malware's and Ransomware's.
    <br><br>
    <b>That being said, thanks for reading! And Have a fantastic day!ðŸ˜„</b>
